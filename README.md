# OPT-Project
Project for the Optimization with Metaheuristics 2015 course at DTU. 
The task is to optimize the time it takes to package a given set of orders at Lundbeck, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world.
We apply the Tabu metaheuristic search algorithm to explore a potentially extremely large solution space, being a harder version of the travelling salesman problem.
We additionally use the F-race algorithm for hyperparameter selection in the Tabu algorithm.
